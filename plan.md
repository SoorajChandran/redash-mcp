Awesome. Here's a step-by-step execution plan for building an **MCP server** (i.e. an agent or service that can interact with Redash and respond conversationally) using **Cursor** and designed for a junior engineer to follow. This guide assumes a working knowledge of basic Python and web dev concepts.

### ðŸ§  Goal Summary:
Build an MCP (Master Control Program) server that:
- Receives natural language queries
- Converts them to SQL
- Queries Redash
- Returns insights in a human-readable format

## ðŸª¼ Step-by-Step Execution Plan

---

### **Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment**

1. Install Python (>=3.9) if not already installed
2. Open Cursor IDE
3. Set up a Python virtual environment in the folder
4. Install necessary dependencies: FastAPI (web server), Uvicorn (ASGI server), OpenAI SDK, HTTP client (e.g. Requests), dotenv for environment variables

---

### **Step 2: Configure Redash Access**

1. Obtain Redash base URL and API key
2. Store them in environment variables for secure access
3. Confirm API key has permission to run queries

---

### **Step 3: Build the MCP API Skeleton**

1. Create a simple HTTP POST endpoint `/ask` that accepts a JSON body with a natural language question
2. Define request and response formats
3. For now, echo back the received question to test the setup

---

### **Step 4: Query Redash with SQL**

1. Use the Redash API to execute ad-hoc queries
2. Construct the request body with SQL and data source ID
3. Handle the API response: wait for job completion, then fetch results
4. Extract the rows or aggregates needed from the response
